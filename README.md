# SFValidate - SFSymbol Validation Script

Python script to format &amp; validate a list of SFSymbols against sfsymbols.com

# About

When I received a email containing a list of SFSymbols needing to be placed in an app, I needed to validate they were all correct. I could see some had incorrect casings, and I didn't want to do it manually... So what did I do? Turned a five minute task into a thirty minute task!

Anyway, hope you get some use out of this!

# Usage

`python ./sfvalidate.py symbols.txt -o results.txt`

## example output

```
âœ… alarm
âœ… gamecontroller.fill
âœ… paintpalette
ðŸ†˜ cup.and.saucer
ðŸ†˜ fork.knife
âœ… figure.walk
âœ… ear
```

# TODO

- [] read input of typed / pasted txt if no file is provided
- [] wrap-in-quotes arg: prepares the list to be copied and pasted into an app
